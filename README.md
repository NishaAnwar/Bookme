__Task Description__:
Our Task was to build a simple chatbot in which we will first convert a small database into vector embeddings.We will use chromadb to store these vector embeddings.
Then we will allow user to  chat with out chatbot and input a query. User entered query will be converted into a vector Embedding .User's Input vector Embedding is matched
with the Embeddings in the chromadB . Most relevant or top matched Vector Embeddings will be retreieved and their cosine similarity with the user entered query is calculated.
